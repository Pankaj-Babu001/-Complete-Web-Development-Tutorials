    4. üè∑Ô∏è Understanding IP Addresses (10 mins):

        IP = Address for every device.
            Unique identifier for each device on a network.
            Assigned by the Internet Service Provider (ISP).
            Can be static (permanent) or dynamic (temporary).


        Explain Static vs Dynamic IP with ISP examples.
            Static IP: Assigned to a device permanently (e.g., web server).
                Always the same, used for hosting websites.

            Dynamic IP: Changes periodically (e.g., home user).
                Assigned from a pool of IPs, can change on reconnect.

            Explain how ISPs manage IP addresses.
                ISPs maintain a pool of IP addresses and assign them to customers as needed.
                They use DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) to automate the process.
                ISPs also keep track of which IPs are assigned to which customers.

            DNS resolves URL to IP address.
            Browser sends HTTP request to IP address.
            Server processes request and sends back response.
            Browser renders the page.

        Browser ‚Üí DNS ‚Üí IP ‚Üí Server ‚Üí Response ‚Üí Rendered page.

            Data Collisions occur when multiple devices try to send data simultaneously.
                Collision Detection: Protocols like CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) help manage collisions in Ethernet networks.
            
            ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) helps map IP addresses to MAC addresses.

    
        MAC Address = Hardware-level identity ‚Üí Like device‚Äôs fingerprint.
